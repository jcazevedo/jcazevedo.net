# About

I'm a Software Engineer currently working at [ShiftForward](http://www.shiftforward.eu/). My interests in computer science usually revolve around artificial intelligence, machine learning, data mining, algorithms, data structures and programming languange theory. I tend to [read](http://www.goodreads.com/jcazevedo), mostly computer science textbooks and science-fiction novels. I [listen to](http://www.last.fm/user/jcazevedo) and collect a lot of music. I have a tendency for electronic, experimental and indie music and I'm very fond of what people call [intelligent dance music](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_dance_music). I make an effort to keep as much of the code I write [open-source](https://github.com/jcazevedo). I also take [photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jcazevedo).

In case you're interested, you can also grab my [CV](/contents/cv.pdf).
