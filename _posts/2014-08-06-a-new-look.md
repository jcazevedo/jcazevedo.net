# A New Look

I confess that this site has been neglected for far too long. Yesterday I
thought that it deserved some attention and tried to improve its design a bit. I
like clean, hassle-free designs. The previous looks of this site was my attempt
at that. It was rushed though. The fonts were not thoroughly chosen, and it
didn't look good on mobile devices. This time around, I decided to get a
stronger inspiration from people that know what they're doing. I first started
to look at themes for [Jekyll][jekyll], as it is the generator that is currently
powering this site. Eventually I came around at [Poole][poole], a sort of helper
for Jekyll. Poole currently supports two official themes: [Hyde][hyde] and
[Lanyon][lanyon]. I like Hyde's fonts, but not its sidebar, so I adapted its CSS
stylesheet to suit my tastes, using what Poole calls the `masthead` to have the
site name and main navigation links. I'm pretty satisfied with the end result,
and it is now finally readable on mobile devices. Let's hope this provides me
with extra motivation to push new content more frequently.
