# Colophon

The contents of this site are written in [Emacs][emacs], in a mix of
[Markdown][markdown] and HTML. A static site is generated from the
[Markdown][markdown] and HTML files using [Jekyll][jekyll]. The current style
being used is a modified version of the one in [Hyde][hyde]. The most up-to-date
source is available on [GitHub][github]. The generated static site is synced
with my [DreamHost][dreamhost] box using [rsync][rsync].
