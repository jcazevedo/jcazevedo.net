# About

I'm a Software Engineer currently working at [ShiftForward][1], where I'm involved in the development of large-scale systems for the online advertising industry. My interests in computer science usually revolve around artificial intelligence, machine learning, data mining, algorithms, data structures and programming languange theory. I tend to [read][2], mostly computer science textbooks and science-fiction novels. I [listen to][3] and collect a lot of music. I have a tendency for electronic, experimental and indie music and I'm very fond of what people call [intelligent dance music][4]. I make an effort to keep as much of the code I write [open-source][5]. I also take [photos][6].

In case you're interested, you can grab my [CV][7]. You can contact me through [email][8], [twitter][9] or [IRC][10]. I usually lurk in the [freenode][11] network under the 'jcazevedo' handle.
