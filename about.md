# About

I'm a Software Engineer currently working at [Kevel][kevel], where I'm involved
in the development of large-scale systems for the online advertising industry.
My interests in computer science usually revolve around artificial intelligence,
machine learning, data mining, algorithms, data structures and programming
language theory. I tend to [read][goodreads], mostly computer science textbooks
and science-fiction novels. I [listen to][last.fm] and collect a lot of music. I
have a tendency for electronic, experimental and indie music and I'm very fond
of what people call [intelligent dance music][idm]. I [play][steam] and collect
a lot of computer games as well. I like indie, difficult and puzzle-related
games, but end up playing a lot of different genres. I make an effort to keep as
much of the code I write [open-source][github].

In case you're interested, you can grab my [CV][cv]. You can contact me through
[email][email] or [twitter][twitter].
