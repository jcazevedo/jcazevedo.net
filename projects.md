# Projects

The following is a list of projects I have worked on or am currently working on.

[PureConfig](https://github.com/pureconfig/pureconfig) (2016 -- )

: A boilerplate-free Scala library for loading configuration files written in
[HOCON][hocon], Java `.properties` or JSON. I started contributing to the
project in 2016 and am now one of the maintainers.

[Solutions to LeetCode problems](https://github.com/jcazevedo/leetcode/) (2016 -- )

: [LeetCode][leetcode] is an online platform providing coding and algorithmic
problems. Every now and then I solve problems there.

[MoultingYAML](https://github.com/jcazevedo/moultingyaml) (2015 -- )

: A Scala wrapper for [SnakeYAML][snakeyaml], providing a simple immutable model
of the YAML language, built on top of SnakeYAML models, as well as type class
based (de)serialization of custom objects.

[Solutions to Advent of Code problems](https://github.com/jcazevedo/advent-of-code) (2015 -- 2023)

: [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an advent calendar of small
programming puzzles. There were years in which I solved the problems in Scala
([2015](https://github.com/jcazevedo/advent-of-code/tree/master/2015),
[2016](https://github.com/jcazevedo/advent-of-code/tree/master/2016),
[2017](https://github.com/jcazevedo/advent-of-code/tree/master/2017),
[2020](https://github.com/jcazevedo/advent-of-code/tree/master/2020),
[2021](https://github.com/jcazevedo/advent-of-code/tree/master/2021/scala),
[2022](https://github.com/jcazevedo/advent-of-code/tree/master/2022)), two years
in which I solved them in C++
([2019](https://github.com/jcazevedo/advent-of-code/tree/master/2019),
[2023](https://github.com/jcazevedo/advent-of-code/tree/master/2023)) and a year
in which I dabbled in multiple programming languages
([2018](https://github.com/jcazevedo/advent-of-code/tree/master/2018)).

[Kevel Audience](https://www.kevel.com/audience) (2014 -- )

: A customer data platform for first-party data collection and segmentation for
audience activation and personalization, all deployed on a private
infrastructure. It has been one of the projects I've been involved with at
[Kevel][kevel] since 2022 (previously at [Velocidi][velocidi] -- since 2018 --
and [ShiftForward][sf] -- since 2014).

[Mucuchies](https://github.com/ShiftForward/mucuchies) (2014 -- 2016)

: An engine for dashboards that only requires a browser to run. It has been used
to run a dashboard in [ShiftForward][sf]'s office for a while. We haven't
updated it in ages, but might be able to give support to it if the need arises.

[beets-rymgenre](https://github.com/jcazevedo/beets-rymgenre) (2014)

: A plugin for [beets][beets] to fetch genre information from
[rateyourmusic.com][rym]. Itâ€™s written in Python, using lxml and requests.
[rateyourmusic.com][rym] doesn't allow access via scraping or scripts which
accesses the site in an automated fashion, so you should refrain from using this
until they complete their API. I might revive the project once that goes live.

[AdForecaster](https://www.adforecaster.com/) (2012 -- )

: A forecasting engine for online advertising campaigns. It aims to accurately
predict future ad impressions traffic levels and campaign inventory availability
using an unlimited number of targeting variables. It has been one of the
projects I've been involved in since joining [ShiftForward][sf] (now
[Velocidi][velocidi]) in 2012.

[Dance. Don't Fall!](http://dancedontfall.projects.fraunhofer.pt/) (2011)

: A mobile application to monitor the risk of falling while actively reducing it
through dancing exercises. I developed some signal analysis tools for it, while
at [Fraunhofer AICOS][fhp].

[Mover](http://mover.projects.fraunhofer.pt/) (2010)

: A mobile application to promote mobility among elder people. I designed and
developed a new version which allowed for data to be stored and analyzed
remotely, while at [Fraunhofer AICOS][fhp].

[YapR](https://github.com/jcazevedo/YapR) (2010 -- 2011)

: A [YAP][yap] module to provide an interface to [R][r] in the Prolog engine.
I'm not sure if it still works, so use at your own risk.
