[~~AdStax~~ ~~The ShiftForward Private DMP~~ Velocidi's Customer Data Platform](https://www.velocidi.com/product/) (2014 -- )

: A customer data platform for e-commerce websites that provides data
unification, smart segmentation and activation. It has been one of the projects
I've been involved with at [Velocidi][velocidi] (previously [ShiftForward][sf])
since 2014.

[Mucuchies](https://github.com/ShiftForward/mucuchies) (2014 -- 2016)

: An engine for dashboards that only requires a browser to run. It has been used
to run a dashboard in [ShiftForward][sf]'s office for a while. We haven't
updated it in ages, but might be able to give support to it if the need arises.

[beets-rymgenre](https://github.com/jcazevedo/beets-rymgenre) (2014)

: A plugin for [beets][beets] to fetch genre information from
[rateyourmusic.com][rym]. Itâ€™s written in Python, using lxml and requests.
[rateyourmusic.com][rym] doesn't allow access via scraping or scripts which
accesses the site in an automated fashion, so you should refrain from using this
until they complete their API. I might revive the project once that goes live.

[AdForecaster](https://www.adforecaster.com/) (2012 -- )

: A forecasting engine for online advertising campaigns. It aims to accurately
predict future ad impressions traffic levels and campaign inventory availability
using an unlimited number of targeting variables. It has been one of the
projects I've been involved in since joining [ShiftForward][sf] (now
[Velocidi][velocidi]) in 2012.

[Dance. Don't Fall!](http://dancedontfall.projects.fraunhofer.pt/) (2011)

: A mobile application to monitor the risk of falling while actively reducing it
through dancing exercises. I developed some signal analysis tools for it, while
at [Fraunhofer AICOS][fhp].

[Mover](http://mover.projects.fraunhofer.pt/) (2010)

: A mobile application to promote mobility among elder people. I designed and
developed a new version which allowed for data to be stored and analyzed
remotely, while at [Fraunhofer AICOS][fhp].

[YapR](https://github.com/jcazevedo/YapR) (2010 -- 2011)

: A [YAP][yap] module to provide an interface to [R][r] in the Prolog engine.
I'm not sure if it still works, so use at your own risk.
