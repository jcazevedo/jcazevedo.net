# Projects

The following is a list of projects I have worked on or am currently working on.

## As author

[MoultingYAML][moultingyaml]
: MoultingYAML is a Scala wrapper for
[SnakeYAML][snakeyaml], providing a simple immutable model of the YAML language,
built on top of SnakeYAML models, as well as type-class based (de)serialization
of custom objects.

[beets-rymgenre][beets-rymgenre]
: beets-rymgenre is a plugin for [beets][beets] to fetch genre information from
[rateyourmusic.com][rym]. It's written in Python, using lxml and requests.

## As contributor

[Mucuchies][mucuchies]
: Mucuchies is the engine behind [ShiftForward][sf]'s internal dashboard. It
borrows the style from [Dashing][dashing] but is implemented using
[Ember.js][emberjs], requiring only a browser with JavaScript capabilities to
run.
