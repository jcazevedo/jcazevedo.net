# Projects

The following is a list of projects I have worked on or am currently working on.

beets-rymgenre (2014 - )
: beets-rymgenre is a plugin for [beets][beets] to fetch genre information from
[rateyourmusic.com][rym]. It's written in Python, using lxml and requests. It's
available on [GitHub][beets-rymgenre].

mucuchies (2013 - )
: mucuchies is the engine behind [ShiftForward][sf]'s internal dashboard. It
borrows the style from [Dashing][dashing] but is implemented using
[Ember.js][emberjs], requiring only a browser with JavaScript capabilities to
run. It's available on [GitHub][mucuchies].
